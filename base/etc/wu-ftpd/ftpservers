# ftpservers file:
# 
# Format of the file is:
#    ipaddr/hostname   directory-containing-configuration-files
#
#    10.196.145.10   /etc/ftpd/ftpaccess.somedomain/
#    10.196.145.200  /etc/ftpd/ftpaccess.someotherdomain/
#    some.domain      INTERNAL
# 
# The server parses the file and tries to match the IP address connected
# to one found in the ftpservers file.  If a match is found then the path
# to the specified directory that contains the configuration files
# for that specific domain is returned.  If a match is not found, or 
# an invalid directory path is encountered like above, default 
# paths to the configuration files to use are returned.
#
# You can use the actual IP address or a specific hostname.
#
#    10.196.145.20 	/etc/ftpd/config/faqs.org/
#    ftp.some.domain 	/etc/ftpd/config/faqs.org/

# As usual, comments and blanklines are ignored.
