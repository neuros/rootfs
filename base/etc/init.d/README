	Configuration of Init under MontaVista(R) Linux(R)

Most Unix versions have a file here that describes how the scripts
in this directory work, and how the links in the /etc/rc.d/rc?.d/ directories
influence system startup/shutdown.

<Note: We should explain here...>

skeleton shows an example of what an init.d script should look like.

Please consult the MontaVista(R) Zone for more information.
