#  This is a sample /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe script.
#  /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe script is executed by dhcpcd daemon
#  any time it configures or shuts down interface.
#  The following parameters are passed to dhcpcd.exe script:
#  $1 = HostInfoFilePath, e.g  "/etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-eth0.info"
#  $2 = "up" if interface has been configured with the same
#       IP address as before reboot;
#  $2 = "down" if interface has been shut down;
#  $2 = "new" if interface has been configured with new IP address;
#  $3 (optional) = "-d" debug flag passed if dhcpcd daemon has been
#       invoked with "-d" flag
#
# This script sources /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-<interface>.exe which defines 
# a set of variables. 
# NOTE THAT THE DATA IN SOME OF THESE COMES FROM 
# UNTRUSTED SOURCES AND IS UNCHECKED.
# The variables in question are HOSTNAME, DOMAIN, NISDOMAIN, 
# ROOTPATH and DHCPSNAME. Enough quoting is done to ensure that execution
# of this script is safe, but beware if you pass the value of any of
# these variables to another shell or perl script - there is nothing to
# stop an attacker putting dangerous characters in these variables. 
#
# This is important: if noglob not set a filename expansion metachar may be
# included in one of the variables set in the info file and executed
# if that variable is used.
# Try this to see the effect:
# TEST='*'; echo $TEST
set -o noglob
