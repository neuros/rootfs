# The PAM configuration file for the Shadow `login' service
#
# NOTE: If you use a session module (such as kerberos or NIS+)
# that retains persistent credentials (like key caches, etc), you
# need to enable the `CLOSE_SESSIONS' option in /etc/login.defs
# in order for login to stay around until after logout to call
# pam_close_session() and cleanup.

# Outputs an issue file prior to each login prompt (Replaces the
# ISSUE_FILE option from login.defs). Uncomment for use
# auth       required   pam_issue.so issue=/etc/issue

# Disallows root logins except on tty's listed in /etc/securetty
# (Replaces the `CONSOLE' setting from login.defs)

# (Replaces the `NOLOGINS_FILE' option from login.defs)

# This module parses /etc/environment (the standard for setting
# environ vars) and also allows you to use an extended config
# file /etc/security/pam_env.conf.
# (Replaces the `ENVIRON_FILE' setting from login.defs)

# accounts.

# This allows certain extra groups to be granted to a user
# based on things like time of day, tty, service, and user.
# Please uncomment and edit /etc/security/group.conf if you
# wish to use this.

# set access limits.

# it to make sure that removing a user, also removes their mail
# spool file.
