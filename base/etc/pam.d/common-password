# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define  the services to be
#used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix

# The "nullok" option allows users to change an empty password, else
# empty passwords are treated as locked accounts.
#
# (Add `md5' after the module name to enable MD5 passwords)
#
# The "obscure" option replaces the old `OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB' option in
# login.defs. Also the "min" and "max" options enforce the length of the
# new password.

password   required   pam_unix.so nullok obscure min=4 max=8 md5

# Alternate strength checking for password. Note that this
# requires the libpam-cracklib package to be installed.
# You will need to comment out the password line above and
# uncomment the next two in order to use this.
# (Replaces the `OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB', `CRACKLIB_DICTPATH')
#
# password required	  pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=6 difok=3
# password required	  pam_unix.so use_authtok nullok md5
