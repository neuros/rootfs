#
# MVLTD_TOOLSDIR

#
# MVLTD_EXMODE
# ------------
#
# This parameter allows user to specify the
# daemon's execution mode. There may be
# the following values for this parameter:
#
#		* exec
#		In this mode, daemon will treat each of
#		the tool found as executable files, and
#		run it in the separate address space as
#		usual standalone application;
#
#		* poll
#		Contary with 'exec', this mode tells daemon
#		to treat all the tools as separate dynamicaly
#		loaded libraries, thus on each request from 
#		the host side the relating tool will be 
#		loaded into the memory with following unload
#		(on connection terminating).
#
MVLTD_EXMODE="poll"
