;======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

; Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = WORKGROUP 

; server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   server string = %h server (Samba %v)

; Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
; WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
   wins support = no

; WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
; Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

; This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
   dns proxy = no

; What naming service and in what order should we use to resolve host names
; to IP addresses
   name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast


;;;; Debugging/Accounting ;;;;

; This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
; that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

; Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
   max log size = 1000

; If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
; parameter to 'yes'.
   syslog only = no

; We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
; should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log
; through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
   syslog = 0

; Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d


;;;;; Authentication ;;;;;

; "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
; in this server for every user accessing the server. See
; /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/ServerType.html in the samba-doc
; package for details.
   security = user

; You may wish to use password encryption.  See the section on
; 'encrypt passwords' in the smb.conf(5) manpage before enabling.
   encrypt passwords = yes 

; If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
; password database type you are using.  
   passdb backend = tdbsam guest

   obey pam restrictions = yes

   guest account = nobody
   invalid users = root

; This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
; password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
; passdb is changed.
   unix password sync = no

; For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
; parameters must be set (thanks to Augustin Luton <aluton@hybrigenics.fr> for
; sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Potato).
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n .


;;;;;;; Printing ;;;;;;;;

; If you want to automatically load your printer list rather
; than setting them up individually then you'll need this
   load printers = yes

; lpr(ng) printing. You may wish to override the location of the
; printcap file
   printing = bsd
   printcap name = /etc/printcap

; CUPS printing.  See also the cupsaddsmb(8) manpage in the
; cupsys-client package.
;   printing = cups
;   printcap name = cups

; When using [print$], root is implicitly a 'printer admin', but you can
; also give this right to other users to add drivers and set printer
; properties
;   printer admin = @ntadmin


;;;;;;;; File sharing ;;;;;;;;;

; Name mangling options
   preserve case = yes
   short preserve case = yes


;;;;;;;;;;;; Misc ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Using the following line enables you to customise your configuration
; on a per machine basis. The %m gets replaced with the netbios name
; of the machine that is connecting
;   include = /home/samba/etc/smb.conf.%m

; Most people will find that this option gives better performance.
; See smb.conf(5) and /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/speed.html
; for details
; You may want to add the following on a Linux system:
;         SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
   socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY SO_SNDBUF=4096 SO_RCVBUF=4096 

; The following parameter is useful only if you have the linpopup package
; installed. The samba maintainer and the linpopup maintainer are
; working to ease installation and configuration of linpopup and samba.
;   message command = /bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/linpopup "%f" "%m" %s; rm %s' &

; Domain Master specifies Samba to be the Domain Master Browser. If this
; machine will be configured as a BDC (a secondary logon server), you
; must set this to 'no'; otherwise, the default behavior is recommended.
;   domain master = auto

; Some defaults for winbind (make sure you're not using the ranges
; for something else.)
;   idmap uid = 10000-20000
;   idmap gid = 10000-20000
;   template shell = /bin/bash

[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   browseable = no

; By default, the home directories are exported read-only. Change next
; parameter to 'yes' if you want to be able to write to them.
   read only = yes

; File creation mask is set to 0700 for security reasons. If you want to
; create files with group=rw permissions, set next parameter to 0775.
   create mask = 0700

; Directory creation mask is set to 0700 for security reasons. If you want to
; create dirs. with group=rw permissions, set next parameter to 0775.

   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
; Uncomment to allow remote administration of Windows print drivers.
; Replace 'ntadmin' with the name of the group your admin users are
; members of.

; A sample share for sharing your CD-ROM with others.
;[cdrom]
;   comment = Samba server's CD-ROM
;   writable = no
;   locking = no
;   path = /cdrom
;   public = yes

; The next two parameters show how to auto-mount a CD-ROM when the
;	cdrom share is accesed. For this to work /etc/fstab must contain
;	an entry like this:
;
;       /dev/scd0   /cdrom  iso9660 defaults,noauto,ro,user   0 0

; The CD-ROM gets unmounted automatically after the connection to the
